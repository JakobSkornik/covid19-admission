    "## Intro\n",
    "\n",
    "This repository contains source code and report for a seminar paper in the context of the course *Machine Learning* in the winter semester 2021/2021 at Faculty of Computer and Information science, University of Ljubljana.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains anonymized data from Hospital Sírio-Libanês, São Paulo and Brasilia. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Context (*copied from the above-specified Kaggle dataset*)\n",
    "COVID-19 pandemic impacted the whole world, overwhelming healthcare systems - unprepared for such intense and lengthy request for ICU beds, professionals, personal protection equipment and healthcare resources.\n",
    "Brazil recorded first COVID-19 case on February 26 and reached community transmission on March 20.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Data has been cleaned and scaled by column according to Min Max Scaler. In total, there are 54 features (expanded when pertinent to the mean, median, max, min, diff and relative diff). \n",
    "\n",
    "### Available Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Features in the dataset can be grouped in four groups:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Group | Amount of features |\n",
    "| ----- | ------------------ |\n",
    "| Demographics | 3 |\n",
    "| Grouped diseases | 9 |\n",
    "| Blood results | 36 |\n",
    "| Vital signs | 6 |\n",
    "| **Total**| **54** |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Window Concept\n",
    "\n",
    "Data for each patient has been grouped in five windows, each containing diagnostic results from the respective time window. \n",
    "\n",
    "Time window table:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Window      | Description |\n",
    "| ----------- | ----------- |\n",
    "| 0-2         | From 0 to 2 hours of the admission |\n",
    "| 2-4         | From 2 to 4 hours of the admission |\n",
    "| 4-6         | From 4 to 6 hours of the admission |\n",
    "| 6-12        | From 6 to 12 hours of the admission |\n",
    "| Above 12    | Above 12 hours from admission |\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1: *Time windows.*\n",
    "\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle dataset warns not to use data from the window where the target variable is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means we need to manipulate our data a little. For example let's take a look at the following time tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Window      | Patient admitted to ICU | Data can be used for modelling | Target variable |\n",
    "| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n",
    "| 0-2         | False | True | 1 |\n",
    "| 2-4         | False | True | 1 |\n",
    "| 4-6         | False | True | 1 |\n",
    "| 6-12        | True | False |  |\n",
    "| Above 12    | True | False |  |\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient is admitted in the fourth time window (6-12 from initial non-ICU admission). This means we can use data from the first three time windows with target variable being 1 (patient being admitted to the ICU ward).\n",
    "\n",
    "| Window      | Patient admitted to ICU | Data can be used for modelling | Target variable |\n",
    "| ----------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |\n",
    "| 0-2         | False | True | 0 |\n",
    "| 2-4         | False | True | 0 |\n",
    "| 4-6         | False | True | 0 |\n",
    "| 6-12        | False | True | 0 |\n",
    "| Above 12    | False | True | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient is never admitted to the ICU, we can therefore use all time windows with target variable 0."
