    "COVID-19 pandemic impacted the whole world, overwhelming healthcare systems - unprepared for such intense and lengthy request for ICU beds, professionals, personal protection equipment and healthcare resources.\n",
    "Brazil recorded first COVID-19 case on February 26 and reached community transmission on March 20."

    "\n",
    "Predict admission to the ICU of confirmed COVID-19 cases.\n",
    "Based on the data available, is it feasible to predict which patients will need intensive care unit support?\n",
    "The aim is to provide tertiary and quarternary hospitals with the most accurate answer, so ICU resources can be arranged or patient transfer can be scheduled (*copied from Kaggle article*).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Kaggle article warns not to use data from the window where the target variable is 1. This means we need to manipulate our data a little. For example let's take a look at the following time tables:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Window      | Patient admitted to ICU | Data can be used for modelling | Target variable |\n",
    "| ----------- | :-----------: | :-----------: | :-----------: |\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Patient is admitted in the fourth time window (6-12 from initial non-ICU admission). This means we can use data from the first three time windows with target variable being 1 (patient being admitted to the ICU ward).\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "| Window      | Patient admitted to ICU | Data can be used for modelling | Target variable |\n",

    "\n",
    "If we take a look at the following snippet from the original Kaggle article:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is reasonable to assume that a patient who does not have a measurement recorded in a time window is clinically stable, potentially presenting vital signs and blood labs similar to neighboring windows. Therefore, one may fill the missing values using the next or previous entry. Attention to multicollinearity and zero variance issues in this data when choosing your algorithm.\n",
